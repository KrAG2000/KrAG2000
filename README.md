ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Kartik, a descent working professional, eager to learn new tech-stack and develop web applications.

ðŸ’» My technical skills include full stack development, AI and ML application development, RAG integration, API development and integration, deployment using various tools. 
My tech stack includes React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap 4/5, MySQL, Drupal 8/9, Apache Unomi and C++, Java, Python and Javascript as programming languages. Iâ€™m also well-versed in using tools like Jira, Git and Jenkins, ensuring smooth collaboration, handling deployment and version control in projects.

ðŸ›  I love designing systems with a focus on efficiency, aiming for maximum output with minimal trade-offs.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m building from scratch, an application using Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain, using Python as the programming language, with use case of web personalisation. I'm also exploring use cases of this new technology in other fields.
