👋 Hey, I’m Kartik — I like building things that actually solve problems.

💻 I work mostly with JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and AWS, and enjoy building backend-heavy SaaS systems that don’t fall apart in production.

🤖 Lately, I’ve been deep into AI stuff, building LLM-powered features with OpenAI and Gemini, experimenting with RAG and vector search, and putting together AI agents that plug cleanly into real products.

⚙️ I care a lot about performance, reliability, and cost. Retries, fallbacks, latency tuning, and making systems behave when things go wrong. That's what I do!

🌱 Currently exploring open source, better AI system design, and ways to make AI features feel boringly reliable.
